                                Most people believe the suggestions of their family and friends much more than what advertisements suggest. This is why communication with your audience is extremely important. Numbers and statistics provide the data to track a promotional campaign or the success of your product or service, but only to a point. If you really want to improve the communication of your ideas and contact your audiences, it is necessary to expand the consumer experience.
With a Image Gallery QR code, you can connect your audience to the production process; with a Video QR code, you can include testimonials from workers and the clients themselves; or with a Link Listing QRFY code, actively link your brand with a social cause to show your commitment to others.

            <h3 class="jss244">Best Practices for Using QR Codes on <span class="blue">Signs</span></h3>
            <p class="jss245">Today, QR codes are no longer restricted to the boring monochrome initial design. Now you can design it to your liking with a variety of creative tools, including to fit the aesthetic of your brand or campaign. Here we present some of the functions at your disposal.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your code with QRFY, do not forget to encourage consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored: “join our networks”, “Get discounts on your next purchase”, “ contact us.” The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your clothing items, or adapts to the brand's aesthetics. Once the QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract consumers' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, modify the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own logo in the center of your QR code. While you can opt for one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "See our new collection" or "Follow us on Instagram." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one. With QRFY you can save all your designs and reuse them in new marketing campaigns: if you want to promote a new drink or a new flavor for a limited time, but want to maintain the aesthetics of your design, you can reuse a saved design, instead of starting another one from scratch. zero.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">5. Customizable URL</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By default, each dynamic QR code gets a random short URL that redirects to your page when the QR code is scanned. The short URL can be customized to your preferences, such as including your company name, to help differentiate you from the competition and build more trust among users.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">6. Test before printing</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When printing your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended print size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.</p>
