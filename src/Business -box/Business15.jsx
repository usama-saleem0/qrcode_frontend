            <p class="jss245">Today, QR codes are no longer restricted to the boring monochrome initial design. Now you can design it to your liking with a variety of creative tools, including to fit the aesthetic of your brand or campaign. Here we present some of the functions at your disposal, so that your advertising campaign reaches a wider audience.</p>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your code in QRFY, don't forget to incentivize consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored: “Join our networks”, “Watch the trailer”, “Get more information ”. The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
            </li>

                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your clothing items, or adapts to the brand's aesthetics. Once the QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract consumers' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, modify the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own logo in the center of your QR code. While you can opt for one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "See our new collection" or "Follow us on Instagram." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one. With QRFY you can save all your designs and reuse them in new marketing campaigns: if you want to promote a new drink or a new flavor for a limited time, but want to maintain the aesthetics of your design, you can reuse a saved design, instead of starting another one from scratch. zero.</p>

                <h4 class="jss248">5. Customizable URL</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By default, each dynamic QR code gets a random short URL that redirects to your page when the QR code is scanned. The short URL can be customized to your preferences, such as including your company name, to help differentiate you from the competition and build more trust among users.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">6. Test before printing</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When printing your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended print size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.</p>

                                The QR code is an advanced version of the barcode that transmits information instantly when scanned with a mobile device. It was created in the 1990s by DENSO WAVE, to process a larger number of characters, faster. It was initially used by manufacturers; but then, with the rise of smartphones, it became an open source technology, used in multiple areas and for diverse purposes. QR codes are now common, present in both print and digital marketing, and can contain various types of data, such as website links, contact information, text messages, phone numbers, and more. By scanning a QR code, the device can interpret the information contained in the code and take the user to the desired action, such as opening a website, displaying a message, adding contacts, making a phone call, among other possibilities.

                                In recent years, the QR code has undergone a significant evolution, going from being a generic information tool to being more precise and useful in its functionality. Today, QR codes can store up to 4,296 characters of all types and encode texts, such as links to Internet sites, numbers and characters. Thus, a simple QR code can store anything from a PDF file to an image gallery, from an audio track to a video playlist; your contact information, a location on Google Maps and much more. All of this will instantly reach users' mobile devices through a simple scan. If your brand or business holds a giveaway, a QR code will allow you to give users access to the registration form or the publication on social networks that announces it, also having the benefit that those interested will be able to share the code with their friends and family. , whether by text message, email or social networks.

                                Static QR codes do not expire, but they cannot be updated or edited, nor do they have tracking functionality. Instead, our dynamic QR codes allow you to edit them, even after they are printed, and monitor their statistics, such as number of scans, frequency, location, time and operating system used in each scan. If you want to try all the benefits of using dynamic QR codes, you can access our free 7-day trial, with unlimited access to all features. Once this period is over, you can choose a plan that suits your needs, so your QR codes will have an unlimited number of scans.
