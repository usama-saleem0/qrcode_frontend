                    <h2>The benefits of using QR codes in Vehicles</h2>
                    <p>How much time do people spend traveling on public roads, whether on foot, by vehicle or public transportation? Just counting the time spent going to and from work, a person spends, on average, between 30 minutes and an hour getting around. You should ask yourself how to use that time to reach them, convert leads into customers, and improve your sales.</p>
                    <h3>From public roads to the online experience</h3>
                    <p>In a successful marketing campaign, traffic to your online platforms is of vital importance today. For this reason, it is important to be able to reliably measure the results of your advertising efforts in optimizing your site: the quantity of traffic is as important as its quality, so that conversion rates are increasingly higher.
                    QR codes are a tool that allows you to increase traffic to your platforms by instantly guiding your target audience from the advertisement on public roads to the online site(s): a specific landing page, such as an online store, download sites of applications, social networks and much more. In this way, you allow your potential customers to reserve your company's products or services and find your contact information or the location of your stores.</p>

                                It is evident that branded vehicles usually attract the attention of passers-by and drivers, so they are also effective in activating word of mouth about your business or company. Although they are not always profitable, you can perfect their effect in your marketing campaigns with a QR code: profitable by nature, a QR code with an appropriate CTA will soon see its benefits in the calculation of the return on investment (ROI) of your business.
The best thing is that, once printed, you can edit or change its content, depending on what you want to share with your target audience, without any extra cost or effort.
Your car, van or bus can be the medium in which your QR Code becomes a propellant for your marketing campaign.
If you're looking for more followers, you can add a Link Listing QR code, which links users to any of your platforms (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok or Facebook) or to a site with links to all of them. Maybe you want your business vehicle to connect people with a social cause that your company champions: with a dynamic URL QR code you can direct the public to a specific landing page of the foundation to make donations or learn about its actions. Or you can give your audience a voice and listen to their opinions by providing them with a Feedback QR Code, which will allow you to improve your products and services based on the needs of your customers.
In addition, it will allow you to collect and send to your business email the information necessary to analyze the degree of satisfaction and comments of your customers.
Another advantage of using QR codes in vehicles is that it is not necessary to immediately access the information: when scanned, the URL is saved on the mobile device and can be accessed later, whenever the person wants.

            <h3 class="jss244">QR Code Best Practices on <span class="blue">Vehicles</span></h3>
            <p class="jss245">Nowadays, QR codes are no longer limited to their primitive, monochromatic and boring design. Now you can design it to your liking or to fit the aesthetics of your brand or company. With a wide variety of creative tools, a well-designed QR will help you expand your brand recognition and reach a wider audience. Here's a guide to some of the features available to you on QRFY.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget this essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning their code. When creating your QRFY code, don't forget to encourage readers to scan your Code, so they don't miss it and your marketing campaign isn't ignored.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your book, its illustrations or adapts to the aesthetics of the publisher. Once your QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract users' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, customize the shape, and add fully customized CTA text: “Enter here at your own risk,” “Read more about this story,” “Scan me if you want more.” mystery".</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own icon or an illustration in the center of your QR code. Although you can select one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "Visit my networks" or "Discover more Horror literature." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one. With QRFY you can save all your designs as templates and reuse them in new marketing campaigns: if you want to promote a new book in the same saga or series, you can reuse a saved design, instead of starting another design from scratch.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">5. Customizable URL</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Each dynamic QR code creates a short URL, randomly, that redirects the user to your page when scanning the QR code. This short URL can also be customized: you can include the title of the book or the name of the author, to generate more trust among users and stand out from the competition.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">6. Test before printing</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When printing your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended print size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is legible and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.    </p>

            <h3 class="jss252">Explore QR codes for Vehicles in Action</h3>
            <p class="jss253">To know how to implement QR codes in your business vehicles and optimize your marketing campaign with them, we present five examples of fictitious brands, which can inspire you to improve your campaign and increase potential customers.</p>
        
            <ul class="jss254">
                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Event management</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">The fictitious events company Always Together realized that its marketing strategy was stagnant and decided to renew it. So that more people knew about their services and saw the success of their events, they implemented mobile marketing: they incorporated a Image Gallery QR code, both on the doors and on the rear windows of their company's vans. In this way they let the images of their best events speak for themselves. Thus, a traffic jam could allow for a greater number of scans and bored passengers could become potential customers.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Financial and insurance companies</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">Shortly after its birth, the fictitious financial advisory company Mifintech needed to increase its client base. To do this, among other things, it decided to offer people access to its business website and contact information, placing vinyls on their cars, with its logo and a vCard PlusQR code, to provide people instant access to information about your services and attract new customers. This way, many people scanned the code and asked for quotes or additional information while traveling.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Business Consultants</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">The QR code campaign in vehicles really helped the consulting firm Smart Bank to increase access to its services and offer a tempting offer, which encouraged people to come to its service offices. By scanning the Coupon QR code, people obtained a coupon to make a first consultation with a 45% discount. Compatible with any mobile device, potential customers could scan the code, whether on a public road, in a traffic jam, or in a parking lot, and ask about the promotion. The QR code allowed them to quickly save the coupon or send it to their friends via email and social networks.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">

                    <p class="jss257">Today, virtuality has turned online platforms into an effective means of attracting more members to a social cause or non-profit campaign. The Save Native Birds Foundation included a dynamic URL QR code on its vehicle vinyl, to link people to its website, publicize its mission, increase visibility of their cause and receive more donations, both from people on the move and those stuck in traffic. With a personalized button, visitors could access the donation page and do their bit to rescue endangered birds.</p>

                    <p class="jss257">The city council of North City launched a new city tour app that had some popularity at the time of launch, but then lost relevance and no longer received new downloads. By adding a Apps QR code to their urban mobile phones, the application increased its download among citizens and tourists. The QR Code allowed the app to be downloaded from any application store, be it Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore or Apple App Store, providing instant access to anyone interested.</p>

                                Keep in mind that one of the main causes of traffic accidents is the use of a mobile phone while driving. So if you are driving, don't try it. But you can do it if you are parked or in one of those endless traffic jams. Of course, if you're walking down the sidewalk, you can easily scan a vehicle's QR code, the same way you would any other code: launch your smartphone's camera or open the QR code reader app and scan.

                                Of course! Thanks to dynamic QR code technology, they can be edited at any time, even after they have been printed. This is a great way to be able to correct or update your campaign when you consider it necessary.

                                Clear! You can add information about the campaign itself in a QR code: either including a brief description, such as the campaign objective, effective dates, or customer benefits; or participation instructions, if the campaign involves any action on the part of customers, such as in a contest, challenges and sweepstakes. This will allow you to connect effectively with your customers and improve your follow-up metrics. Simply select the QR code you want to add campaign information to, click details, and then “Add information.” Once you have added all the details, your campaign is ready.
