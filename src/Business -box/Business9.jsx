                    <p>Many believe that the consumption of printed newspapers and magazines is dying, but in fact large magazines continue to publish in the traditional format and have incorporated QR codes into their content, to include multimedia content in their publications. The QR codes allow readers to buy the products advertised on their pages without having to wait in long lines, watch videos of the events presented in the notes or access the social networks of the interviewed artists, with just a scanning.</p>

                                Whether it's an interview, a review, a fictional story or a recipe, by implementing QR codes on your pages, you can increase reader trust and strengthen your credibility by turning your magazine or newspaper into a multimedia experience. To encourage readers to keep coming back, use a dynamic URL QR code to link to any destination URL, whether it's a MP3 QR code with the full audio of the latest interview, a Video QR code with cooking or craft tutorials or a Feedback QRFY code, so that your readers can rate different aspects of your magazine and make suggestions. With a simple scan, you can amplify the content of your publication and surprise the reader with your original and creative content, so that they continue purchasing it and recommending it to their friends.

                                How many authors write for your magazine or newspaper? How much do your readers know about them? Usually the only thing known about each author is their name, located at the beginning or end of each publication, with or without a small photo in the medium plane. Now, with a simple QR code, you can link readers from print to digital: make it easy for people to access more content from the same writer with a Link Listing QR code next to their name, or learn more about the author with a Business QR code, linking them to their site and contact information, in case other editors or individuals want to contact them.

This greatly simplifies access to promotions, without the hassle of cutting out and saving printed coupons, which often get torn or lost. Digital coupons with QR code can be easily scanned, saved, shared and redeemed with any mobile device.

                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your code with QRFY, do not forget to encourage consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored: “join our networks”, “Get discounts on your next purchase”, “ contact us.” The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
