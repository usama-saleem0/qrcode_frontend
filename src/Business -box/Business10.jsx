                                Make your advertising posters more than just an attractive print. You can make them fun and bold, inviting people to play, like in the campaign for the movie “Us”, by Jordan Peele, whose poster invited fans to look for clues. A QR code will allow you to connect the printed marketing of your poster with your digital campaign and expand the possibilities when it comes to connecting with people, in a creative and playful way. With a Video QR code on your poster, your customers will be able to access exclusive content, interviews or behind the scenes, interactive games and much more. Additionally, if you are a musician or part of a record label, our MP3 QR code will allow you to share songs from your latest production or a podcast interview with the band members. Or, with our Dynamic URL QR Code, direct people from your poster to your online site, or link them to any page on the web, such as a recipe, contact form, social media accounts , video, etc.

                                Posters are an essential part of marketing in the entertainment industry, but that is not their only use: they are frequently used in academic and commercial presentations. In these cases, the QR code allows attendees at a conference, symposium or fair to be linked to a wide variety of information. You can expand on the information presented in the poster with our PDF QR code, which allows the public to access more material, cited works, or even research results that support your arguments. Plus, if you're presenting your brand or product, you can provide event attendees with a digital version of your brochures, catalogs, e-books, and more. With a simple scan of your QR code, users will be able to save these documents on their devices and access their information at any time. If you're at a convention, you can present your potential clients with a sample of your work with our Image Gallery QR code, which allows you to create an album to display your works or products from more than one angle.

                                The effectiveness of posters lies in the possibility of capturing people's attention automatically. But so that it doesn't become a fleeting moment, you can motivate people to go beyond the images: with a Event QR code, you can give people valuable information about your event and motivate them to that they attend. On the page provided, compatible with any mobile device, you can describe your event, show dates and times, venue information, the precise address on Google Maps and even add a button to buy tickets or RSVP. From the page, guests will be able to save the event directly to their calendars or connect with you to request more information.

            <h3 class="jss244">QR Code Best Practices in <span class="blue">Posters</span></h3>
            <p class="jss245">Today, QR codes are no longer restricted to the boring monochrome initial design. Now you can design it to your liking with a variety of creative tools, including to fit the aesthetic of your brand or campaign. Here we present some of the functions at your disposal.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your code in QRFY, don't forget to incentivize consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored: “Join our networks”, “Watch the trailer”, “Get more information ”. The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your clothing items, or adapts to the brand's aesthetics. Once the QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract consumers' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, modify the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own logo in the center of your QR code. While you can opt for one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "See our new collection" or "Follow us on Instagram." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one. With QRFY you can save all your designs and reuse them in new marketing campaigns: if you want to promote a new drink or a new flavor for a limited time, but want to maintain the aesthetics of your design, you can reuse a saved design, instead of starting another one from scratch. zero.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">5. Customizable URL</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By default, each dynamic QR code gets a random short URL that redirects to your page when the QR code is scanned. The short URL can be customized to your preferences, such as including your company name, to help differentiate you from the competition and build more trust among users.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">6. Test before printing</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When printing your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended print size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.</p>

                                While there is no precise size for every printed medium, it is essential to keep some basic rules in mind when designing QR codes for posters: The minimum recommended size is 2 x 2 cm, to ensure that it is visible and scannable. For small posters, a common size is 11” x 17”, while for medium posters it is common to find 18” x 24” QR codes. For large posters, the size is usually 24” x 36” or larger; Keep in mind that the size of the QR code must match that of the poster and that by printing it in a larger size you can ensure its visibility from a distance.
