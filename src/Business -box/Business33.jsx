                                Nowadays, people place undoubted importance on brand transparency, especially when it comes to purchasing products. Many companies have had to make their supply chain visible to recover or maintain their reputation, through transparency. With QRFY codes, you will allow your audience to know the history of your company through the voice of workers and suppliers, images of the production and supply process, instead of giving a simple summary in the description of your company.

The Video QR code and the Image Gallery QR code can help you share supply chain information in a fun and engaging way. Host events with ease and let your attendees easily save and share them with the Event QR code.

            <p class="jss245">Today, QR codes are no longer restricted to the boring monochrome initial design. Now you can design it to your liking with a variety of creative tools, including to fit the aesthetic of your brand or campaign. Here we present five practices that will improve the design of your QR codes.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your code with QRFY, do not forget to encourage consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored: “join our networks”, “Get discounts on your next purchase”, “ contact us.” The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your digital signage, or adapts to the brand's aesthetics. Once the QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract consumers' attention.

                    <p class="jss257">Agency Real Build knows from experience that the more people see a product, the more likely it is to sell. Therefore, to boost property sales, they used digital signage to share highlighted information with their potential clients and keep it up to date, as they sold properties. With our vCard Plus QR codeincluded in the signage design, potential clients were able to contact a real estate agent directly and schedule an appointment instantly.</p>

One of the objectives of your presentations there is to obtain contacts, interested in your services and exchange information. In the last seminar, they promoted their new investment application: to guarantee its arrival and a greater number of downloads, they included in each of the slides of their presentation, our Apps QR code, which redirected users directly to the download, with access to any of the large application stores (Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Apple App Store). At the same time, the company was able to measure how many people scanned the code each day of the seminar.</p>

To do this, it promoted its satisfaction questionnaire, with our Feedback QR code, included on the digital screens in North City's public spaces. In this way, citizens and tourists were able to instantly scan and complete the form, divided into categories and areas of interest, to help the government improve its services. QRFY also allows them to add, delete or edit the content of the form at any time, without having to change the code.</p>

So instead of printing their brochures, they converted them into e-brochures, which they uploaded to a PDF QR code. Then, they added it to the slides on their digital screen. This way, anyone who was interested in learning more about the foundation could scan the code and save the file to their mobile devices. Digitizing the brochure also allowed them to include a customizable button, which linked users to the Save Native Birds donation page.</p>

                                    What are the benefits of using QR codes on digital posters?

                                The QR code, used in any marketing materials, allows viewers to access additional information by scanning the code, increasing interaction and engagement by making it easier for viewers to access websites, videos, app downloads or other relevant information quickly and easily. But it also has a fundamental benefit compared to traditional marketing tools: it allows you to measure the results of a campaign, in real time, and improve your ROI (return on investment). QR codes can track scanning activity, giving you data on the effectiveness of your poster and overall advertising campaign, plus the flexibility to edit and update information, without additional costs, when you need it.

                                Of course! QR codes are two-dimensional information tools that store data in various marketing materials. They function as versatile channels, making them a portable and effective means of transmitting information. They can contain links to online stores, videos, image galleries, applications, audio tracks and much more. A QR code, whether printed or inserted in any material (physical or digital), is enough for this content to reach customers quickly and effectively, in just one scan.
