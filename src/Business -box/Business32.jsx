You can choose from a wide variety of colors, custom frames and original borders, include your logo or image in the center of your design and create a call to attention (CTA) so that people do not stop scanning it. This way you can make your QR code match perfectly with the design of your emails.

            <p class="jss245">To be successful in terms of design and results, email marketing requires some essential features. Therefore, here we offer you some tips to make your email campaign with QR codes a success.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Highlight your CTA</h4>
                <p class="jss249">The CTA is a fundamental element for the success of your QR code: it is a call to action, which encourages users to take a specific action: "Buy now" or "Enter the giveaway". The QR designs you include in your emails should have a CTA that stands out so that recipients don't hesitate to scan it.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Use your brand style</h4>
                <p class="jss249">As with other advertising mediums, email should also reflect the style of your brand, product or service you want to promote. Individualize your advertising email with your creative brand design and make your QR code match and integrate perfectly with its aesthetic, since QRFY allows you to customize all aspects of its appearance.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Optimize your campaign results</h4>
                <p class="jss249">There is always a way to improve and make your marketing campaign more efficient. With QRFY's tracking function you can analyze the results of your email campaign, to improve and optimize it, varying the type of audience, the content shared or the frequency of sending emails.</p>

                                The appropriate size for your QR code may vary depending on the design of your email, the surrounding elements, and how much visibility and importance you want to give it to the content. As a general rule, it is recommended that QR codes be at least 2 x 2 cm and located in a clear area, to ensure effective scanning. For emails, the minimum sizes may be sufficient. However, it is advisable that you test the QR code on different devices to verify that it is readable for all users.

                                The answer is no: the type of QR code will depend on the objectives of your campaign and the product or service you want to promote. You may want to add a QR code to emails simply to point to your contact information, but you can also use them to promote events, app downloads, or your social media accounts.
