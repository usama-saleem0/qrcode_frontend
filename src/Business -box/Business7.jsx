                    <h2>Benefits of using QR codes in your Clothing Brand</h2>
                    <p>If you are part of the fashion industry, you have the possibility to improve the customer experience and reach new buyers by including QR codes on your garments. The current situation, in which environmental damage, labor exploitation, animal abuse and cultural appropriation, among other problems, are constantly reported, make it necessary for brands to be increasingly transparent and show their clients and potential clients the production process. ; QR codes are an opportunity to do this in a creative way, by including a Video QR code or Image Gallery QR code, so they can witness the production process of the garments, from obtaining the raw materials to their arrival in the stores. Thus, your brand will stand out by showing that you are a sustainable brand, committed to society and the environment.</p>

                                Today, socially and environmentally conscious brands are more attractive to buyers. For this reason, many clothing companies include in their marketing campaigns the support and collaboration in a social cause or awareness campaign, through the incorporation of a QR code in their clothing lines. You can also contribute to your community, including a link to a donation page with our dynamic URL QR code or make a campaign reach more people with a Link Listing QR code

            <h3 class="jss244">Best practices of QR Codes applied in <span class="blue">Clothing</span></h3>
            <p class="jss245">The evolution of QR codes means that today you are no longer limited to the traditional monochrome and boring format. Now you can design it in a variety of colors and shapes, so that it adapts to your brand's identity. Here we present some of the functions you have in QRFY.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">In the past, QR code users often forgot an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your QR code, don't forget to incentivize consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored. The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your clothing items, or adapts to the brand's aesthetics. Once the QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract consumers' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, modify the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own logo in the center of your QR code. While you can opt for one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "See our new collection" or "Follow us on Instagram." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one. With QRFY you can save all your designs and reuse them in new marketing campaigns: if you want to promote a new drink or a new flavor for a limited time, but want to maintain the aesthetics of your design, you can reuse a saved design, instead of starting another one from scratch. zero.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">5. Customizable URL</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By default, each dynamic QR code gets a random short URL that redirects to your page when the QR code is scanned. The short URL can be customized to your preferences, such as including your company name, to help differentiate you from the competition and build more trust among users.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">6. Test before printing</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When printing your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended print size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.</p>

                    <p class="jss257">The plus size collection from Shop Local did not have the expected significance. That's why they decided to double their marketing efforts and created a new campaign to attract customers to the collection: they created a new lookbook, which they spread online with the hashtag #VivaLaDiversidad, with models of all sizes. In addition, they printed a QR code in Video on the labels of their clothing, with the CTA message “Live diversity”, to access a video playlist: in each video they could see the same garment worn by various models, from size zero to eight. Thus, they were able to show different garments and outfits, so that anyone interested in purchasing them would have a rough idea of how a certain garment would look on them and the confidence of finding their size.</p>

These QR codes are typically printed on product labels and can be scanned by mobile devices to access digital content related to the garment or brand. The QR grants instant access to information hidden within the Code, which can store up to 4,296 characters of all types, and which in turn can be encoded. QR codes specifically for clothing are a tool used by brands to improve the shopping experience and interactively connect with interested customers.

The code is probably on an item of clothing you bought or are about to buy; But in some cases, companies add a QR code to their employees' uniforms, either to make comments about service, enter their website or access catalogs. In this case, before pointing the camera at him, try to ask the employee for permission.
