            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Check accessibility</h4>
                <p class="jss249">To create a QR code, it is important to check the size and proper contrast, as appearance and accessibility are essential to attract customers' attention. Make sure your QR code has the appropriate size and color contrast, that it is neither too small nor too large compared to the accompanying image, and that it clearly indicates what it is promoting.</p>

                <p class="jss249">Social media marketing receives the best results when it focuses on innovation and continued optimization. To do this, it is essential to study which platforms are most successful in promoting your products or services, what type of images and information attract followers, and track the performance of the QR code.</p>

                <h4 class="jss248">3. Give it your personal touch</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Images on social networks can generate much more interaction if users identify your brand or company just by seeing them. By customizing your QR codes, you can adapt any type of image from your social networks, so that the public instantly relates them to your brand, whether in your account feed, in stories or ads. Make sure to always include a CTA so users know why they should scan your QR code.</p>

            <p class="jss253"> You probably still have questions about the way companies use QR codes on their social networks. Here we present some fictitious examples so that you can visualize the possibilities and benefits of including QR codes in your networks.</p>
        
            <ul class="jss254">
                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Restaurants</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">Like many other food chains, Los Burgueses 's advertising focuses largely on social media to keep its loyal customers happy and attract new ones. To promote their new student menu, they placed a Coupon QR code in a feed post, along with a tempting image of the combo, offering an exclusive discount for young followers of their page. In addition, they incorporated an advertisement on social networks into the campaign to interact with new potential customers.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Software and application developers</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">Recently, Space Heroes developed a mobile version of their most popular computer game. To increase downloads of their apps, they posted a Apps QR code on their Instagram and Twitter accounts, as well as an ad on all other social networks and on the homepage of their website. Thanks to the monitoring of our dynamic QR codes, they were able to check from which platforms the greatest number of downloads were made and make variations in the design and dissemination of the QR codes in their next campaigns.</p>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Fashion retailers</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">In the beginning, Shop Local gained great popularity thanks to marketing from its Instagram account. To expand your social media marketing campaign, you decided to include more channels, in order to reach new potential customers and increase awareness of your brand. Instead of publishing a series of links in the Instagram feed, which does not even allow users to click on the text, those in charge of dissemination and networks at Shop Local chose to add a Link Listing QR code, which links your followers to all your new channels on other social networks, such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Hotels</h4>
                    <p class="jss257"> Both hotels and the companies that supply them must ensure, not only that they maintain a high level of guest satisfaction, but also that they meet the expectations of new visitors, in order to continue operating successfully. In order to listen to and consider the opinions of its guests, Sky Resort shared a survey with its previous guests on all its social media accounts. To do this, they chose to include a Feedback QR code, both in their social media feed and on the table tents located on the light tables in each room.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Concerts</h4>
                    <p class="jss257"> The musical band The Storms is working on the advertising campaign for their next concert, in which they will present their next studio album. To do this, the team in charge of marketing set out to optimize the band's dissemination channels. To do this, they have included a Event QR code in the latest publications of all their social media accounts, to complement the television advertisements and posters on public roads. In this way, those who are interested can scan the code to buy their tickets and schedule the event on their devices. In addition, the marketing team can analyze the QR statistics, thanks to the tracking function, to optimize future campaigns.</p>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Doctors and healthcare</h4>
                    <p class="jss257"> Dr. Reinhardt, star doctor at Health Clinic, has many followers on Instagram, where he shares reels with tips for comprehensive health and educating people about good habits. As is known, Instagram does not allow you to click on the links placed at the bottom of the posts, so it created a MP3 QR code to share with its followers and give greater visibility to its new podcast on Spotify . Thus, his followers were able to scan it, subscribe and listen to all its episodes.</p>

                                QR codes are a versatile tool that can improve your social media reach, promote content, increase followers, and improve your customers' experience. Our dynamic QR code generator has many advantages for social media marketing: its codes are customizable, editable and also trackable, so you can optimize your marketing campaigns based on their results. They can be used both in stories and social media posts, as well as in advertisements to maximize results. If you want, for example, to promote a new product or collection, a Link Listing QR code with an attractive design that includes your company logo and a call to action, can direct users to your Instagram profile or to a specific post about your product. You can publish this code on your social networks, on a website, in brochures or in any printed or digital marketing material. Users will then be able to browse your profile, like, comment, share or follow your account to stay informed of future updates.

                                Typically, it is recommended that the minimum size of the QR code be 2 x 2 cm. However, the size of your QR code will depend on how large the image is and the medium or medium in which you are disseminating your QR code, whether printed or digital. Be sure to test your code on multiple devices to ensure it is clearly readable on all types of QR scanners.
