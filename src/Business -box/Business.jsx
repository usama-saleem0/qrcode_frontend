                    <h2>The benefits of using QR codes in Flyers</h2>
                    <p>Easy to create and distribute, digital flyers have not gone out of style. Distributing them in your marketing campaigns appropriately will always allow you to reach a larger audience. The effectiveness of your digital flyer can be even greater by adding a QR code. A scan will make the difference with the traditional flyer: QRFY optimizes your marketing strategy, as it will allow your ad to contact people directly with your online platforms, offers, promotions, social networks and much more.</p>

                    <h3>Renew your traditional flyers with QRFY</h3>

                    <p>This combination of traditional and digital marketing can increase interaction with your audience and will attract new customers to your product or service. With a traditional, well-designed flyer and the inclusion of a QR code, you can catch people's attention and expand the reach of your business, increase popularity on your social networks and attract new customers.</p>


                    <p>Additionally, a dynamic QR code will allow you to record the reach of your flyer, by computing the number and location of scans and even what device the code was scanned with each time. Monitoring these statistics will also allow you to check the effectiveness of the campaign and make changes to the strategy, if necessary; for example, modifying the distribution area or changing the design.</p>
