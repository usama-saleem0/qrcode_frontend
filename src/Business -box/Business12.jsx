            <p class="jss245">Today, QR codes are no longer restricted to the boring monochrome initial design. Now you can design it to your liking with a variety of creative tools, including to fit the aesthetic of your brand or campaign. Here we present some of the functions at your disposal.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget an essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning the code. When creating your code in QRFY, don't forget to incentivize consumers not to miss it and scan it, so that your marketing campaign is not ignored: “Join our networks”, “Watch the trailer”, “Get more information ”. The number of scans will largely depend on this.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your clothing items, or adapts to the brand's aesthetics. Once the QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract consumers' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, modify the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own logo in the center of your QR code. While you can opt for one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "See our new collection" or "Follow us on Instagram." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one.

                                Static QR codes are free, but they can only contain fixed information, meaning they cannot be edited or modified after being generated, nor do they have a tracking function. On the other hand, dynamic QR codes allow you to edit their type and content, without having to reprint it, thus saving time and money. Additionally, dynamic codes have many more design options and allow you to track their metrics, such as the number of scans, their frequency, where and with what operating system they were scanned, etc. Therefore, by allowing you to measure the results of your campaign, you will be able to analyze them and optimize the content and design of your codes. Therefore, by choosing to use dynamic QR codes you are making an investment.
