                    <h2>Benefits of using QR codes in video games</h2>
                    <p> Development companies like Nintendo, over the years, have developed innovations in the field of video games, introducing technologies such as motion controls with the Wii console, augmented reality with the Nintendo 3DS console, and more recently, the hybrid Nintendo Switch that Allows you to play in both portable mode and TV mode.
Nintendo has used QR codes in its games to provide additional content, such as downloadable content (DLC), special in-game items, or even links to trailers and promotional videos for its games. Additionally, in events and marketing campaigns, Nintendo has used QR codes to direct users to websites with additional information about its products, contests, special promotions, among others.
As in this case, many video game developers have already begun to take advantage of the benefits of QR codes in their marketing strategies, to create more attractive experiences for players. Improving the user experience will generate not only customer satisfaction, but also brand loyalty, necessary for customers to purchase your products again.</p>

                                Integrating QR codes into simulation games can greatly increase player engagement.
An example of a video game that includes QR codes within its dynamics is "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" for Nintendo Switch. In this game, QR codes are used as part of a feature called "Custom Design", which allows players to create and share custom patterns for clothing, furniture, and other in-game items. Players can generate custom QR codes using an in-game editor and then share these QR codes online or scan QR codes created by other players, which has led to an active community of skin sharing among players. This use of QR codes in "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" has been very popular and has contributed significantly to the personalized and social gaming experience within the game's virtual world.
QR codes can transmit a wide variety of information in an instant with a simple scan from any mobile device. By selecting a type of QR code, you will be able to upload the necessary information and choose the format in which you want to download your file, whether PNG, JPG or SVG.
In investigation games, for example, you can hide a variety of clues within a QR, without complicating or impacting the graphics of the video game, making the players' experience multiplatform: you can leave a clue on a social network, with a QR code from Link Listing, or in a YouTube tutorial, using a QR code from Video. Or you can leave a track in audio format, which you can include using an MP3 QR code, among many other options.

            <h3 class="jss244">QR Best Practices for <span class="blue">Video Games</span></h3>
            <p class="jss245">QR codes are no longer limited to the black and white aesthetic of their traditional design, but offer a wide range of colors, which can adapt to your brand image. Additionally, you can use various creative tools to make your designs unique. Here are five best practices for creating QR codes.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Customize your design</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By customizing your code with QRFY, with all the options available, you help it adapt to your aesthetic and, consequently, increase awareness of your brand. Once your QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of frames, pre-designed CTA messages and customizable colors, to attract users' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon or logo, customize the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Use the right size</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When creating your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended size, both digital and printed, is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a call to action (CTA)</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget this essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning their code. When creating your code with QRFY, don't forget to incentivize consumers to scan your code, so they don't miss it and your marketing campaign is not in vain.</p>
            </li>

            <h3 class="jss252">Explore QR codes for Video Games in action</h3>
            <p class="jss253"> If you still need inspiration to start using QR codes in your video games, here are some real and fictional cases to spark your creativity.</p>
        
            <ul class="jss254">
                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">New Space Heroes video game for mobile devices</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">Like many video game developers, the fictional company Space Heroes launched the mobile version of one of its popular console games. The mobile version, faithful to the narrative and dynamics of the original game, added new characters and levels, immediately attracting the interest of fans.
                    Players didn't have to search for the new game in mobile app stores, thanks to the developers including an Apps QR code within the home page of the latest update to the original console game, so, when scanning it within the game, they were redirected directly to the download on Google Play, Amazon Appstore or Apple App Store.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Musicalize your video game for fans</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">Fans often search the Internet for music tracks from their favorite video games, to listen to them even when they are not playing. With the MP3 QR code, you can offer players the soundtrack of their favorite game, without having to track them across different music platforms. In this way, with a simple scan, they will be able to access the preview of the tracks in an MP3 file and, with a customizable button, facilitate the purchase of the complete soundtrack in a virtual store.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Promote charitable causes</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">The game "Overwatch", developed by Blizzard Entertainment, introduced a charity campaign called "Mercy's Recall Challenge" to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). To further encourage donations to the foundation, Blizzard implemented QR codes in-game, which redirected players to the BCRF donation page, where they could make direct contributions to support breast cancer research.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">ESports</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">Electronic sports events have a large audience these days: websites promote events, times and locations. To multiply players at events and expand your community, you can include a dynamic URL QR code in your video game to link potential participants directly to your social networks, your website, a live broadcast or registration for an event.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="jss255">
                    <h4 class="jss256">Themed gifts for your players</h4>
                    <p class="jss257">By including a QR code within your games, in a specific update for a holiday, such as Christmas or Easter, you can offer your loyal players benefits in the real world: with a Coupon QR code strategically placed within of the game, offer a discount in gift stores, physical or virtual. Or with a QR code from Apps, redirect to the download of a mobile game, exclusive for fans. You can even redirect your loyal players to a post to participate in giveaways or Christmas challenges, with a Link Listing QR code.</p>
                </li>

                                    Is it possible to scan a QR code without using an app?

                                Of course. Most modern smartphones are equipped with the ability to scan QR codes directly from the camera app. This means that users can easily access the information encoded in the QR code by simply pointing their phone's camera at the code. This integrated functionality further simplifies the process of interacting with QR codes, eliminating the need to download additional applications and offering a more seamless and convenient experience for users.
