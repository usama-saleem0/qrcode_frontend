                                Web banners are digital advertisements that are normally integrated into a specific web page and usually have more images than text. They can appear in various sizes and shapes, as pop-ups on the screen or included in specific places within each page. The objective is to increase traffic to a certain website: by clicking on the banner, users are transported to a landing page of the advertiser, which is why it is essential to capture the attention of visitors. With a QR, your banner can go one step further.

                                Although web banners are effective for sharing the link to a site, they are not so effective when accessing other types of more specific content. If you want, for example, to increase downloads of your app, a normal web banner will only guide visitors to another page with more information. If they wanted to download it, they would have to write its name and search for it in an app store. Instead, including a Apps QR code can help simplify the process by offering potential customers a direct link to download from any app store (be it Google Play, Amazon Appstore, or other apps). ), which will effectively increase downloads.

                                The Internet is a universe of countless possibilities, where a QR code can be the difference between getting lost or finding a precise direction: a QR code can guide users directly to the content you want or what you need them to do: a code Dynamic URL QR can take them directly to your virtual clothing store. If you're a musician, a MP3 QR code can take them directly to your promotional track and, with a customizable button, to the store where they can purchase the full album. If you have a technical service, you can share your contact information or a quote request form, using a Business QR code. Or if you are a visual artist or photographer, share your work using a Image Gallery QR code.

            <p class="jss245">Whats Next? When designing your QR code on banner ads, there are some valuable details to keep in mind so that your efforts get the best results.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Customize your design</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By customizing your QR code, with all the options available, you can adapt it to your aesthetics and, consequently, increase awareness of your brand. Once your QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of frames, pre-designed CTA messages and customizable colors to attract viewers' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon or logo, customize the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Use the right size</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When creating your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all cinema viewers can access your QR code, from any seat, you must carry out tests with various smartphone models and applications.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a call to action (CTA)</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget this essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning their code. When creating your code with QRFY, don't forget to incentivize consumers to scan your code, so they don't miss it and your marketing campaign is not in vain.</p>
