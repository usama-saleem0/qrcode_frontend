                                For new players, who must learn the dynamics and rules of the game from scratch, it can be tedious to have to read the traditional printed manuals in their entirety. On the other hand, a video tutorial is a much more attractive and motivating means to learn the rules of the game. With a Video QR code printed on the booklet or inside the game box, you can offer players a beginner-friendly video tutorial; but also useful guides for construction games or the possibility of learning alternative games with the same pieces. You can even aggregate multiple videos into one mobile-optimized page, which players can access without having to install additional apps.

                                QR codes allow players to enrich the narrative in traditional tabletop adventure, role-playing or strategy games. A QR can connect players with a multimedia experience, taking their imagination to new places. For example, a Apps QR code that allows them to access a game extension in the application store to meet board game challenges; or a MP3 QR code, to set your adventures to music; or a Video QR code, to illustrate certain actions within the game. In all cases, our dynamic URL QR codes will connect you directly to any landing page that amplifies the board game experience.

                                One of the best reasons to use dynamic QR codes is that their information and destination link can always be edited and updated, whenever you need it; even change the type of QR (from MP3 QR code to a coupon QR code, for example). Any typographical or link errors can be edited without changing the appearance of the created QR code.

            <p class="jss245">When designing your QR code to include in your board games, you need to keep the following tips in mind to make your games a success.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Customize your design</h4>
                <p class="jss249">By customizing your QR code with all the available options, you can adapt it to the aesthetics of your game. Once your code is generated with QRFY, you will be able to choose from a wide variety of frames, pre-designed CTA messages and customizable colors, to attract the attention of players. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon or logo, customize the shape, and add completely custom text.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Use the right size</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When creating your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is always readable and can be scanned without difficulty.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a call to action (CTA)</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget this essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the user will earn by scanning their code. When creating your QRFY code, don't forget to encourage visitors to scan your Code and not miss it.</p>

                                Definitely, there have been some QR codes that have brought a smile. Sometimes a lack of clarity or context can make a QR code more entertaining than useful. For example, imagine you scan a code on a packaging and it takes you to a page that looks like it's from the last century, you can't even see it properly on your phone! Now that is a frustrating experience. However, in other cases, QR codes are effectively used to enrich experiences, even in board games. For example, by scanning a QR code on a playing card, players can access additional content, such as advanced rules, additional clues, or even new challenges. It's like having a virtual assistant that expands the game experience and adds excitement to the game. In short, QR codes can be great if used properly, providing an extra layer of interactivity and fun in board games. However, it is crucial that designers think about the needs and expectations of players when incorporating this technology into their games.

                                Yes, a QR code can still work even if it is damaged to some extent. QR codes are designed with redundancy so that they can remain readable even if damaged or partially covered. However, if the damage is very extensive and significantly affects essential elements of the code, such as locating corners or data patterns, the QR code may not be read correctly.

                                QR codes on traffic signs can be a very useful tool to provide additional information to drivers and pedestrians. However, it is essential to ensure that they are used responsibly and safely. If placed in safe locations where they do not interfere with the driver's attention, such as in parking lots or rest areas, they can be beneficial. The key is to ensure appropriate and considered use of QR codes, taking road safety into account at all times.
