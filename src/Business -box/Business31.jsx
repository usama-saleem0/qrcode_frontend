            <h3 class="jss244">QR Code Best Practices on <span class="blue">Websites</span></h3>
            <p class="jss245">Nowadays, QR codes are no longer limited to their primitive, monochromatic and boring design. Now you can design it to your liking or to fit the aesthetics of your brand or company. With a wide variety of creative tools, a well-designed QR will help you expand your brand recognition and reach a wider audience. Here's a guide to some of the features available to you on QRFY.</p>
        <ul class="jss246">

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">1. Add instructions</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Many times QR code users forget this essential detail for the success of their campaign: adding a brief written explanation of what the consumer will gain by scanning their code. When creating your QRFY code, don't forget to encourage readers to scan your Code, so they don't miss it and your marketing campaign isn't ignored.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">2. Frame it</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Access our customizable frames so that your QR code matches the design of your book, its illustrations or adapts to the aesthetics of the publisher. Once your QR code is generated, you can choose from a wide variety of customizable frames and colors, with different CTA messages to attract users' attention. Additionally, if you want to add other details, you have the option to choose a different icon, customize the shape, and add fully customized CTA text: “Enter here at your own risk,” “Read more about this story,” “Scan me if you want more.” mystery".</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">3. Add a logo inside your QR code</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Once you have customized the frame, shape and color of your code, you can also choose to include your own icon or an illustration in the center of your QR code. Although you can select one of the options offered by our QR code generator, you can also upload your own logo and even create your own CTA, such as "Visit my networks" or "Discover more Horror literature." When including your logo, you don't have to worry about image size: our system automatically detects the best size, to ensure your logo remains scannable.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">4. Save your designs</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Sign up for QRFY and you'll be able to reuse your saved QR code designs without needing to manually recreate an old one. With QRFY you can save all your designs as templates and reuse them in new marketing campaigns: if you want to promote a new book in the same saga or series, you can reuse a saved design, instead of starting another design from scratch.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">5. Customizable URL</h4>
                <p class="jss249">Each dynamic QR code creates a short URL, randomly, that redirects the user to your page when scanning the QR code. This short URL can also be customized: you can include the title of the book or the name of the author, to generate more trust among users and stand out from the competition.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="jss247">
                <h4 class="jss248">6. Test before printing</h4>
                <p class="jss249">When printing your QR code, you must keep in mind that the minimum recommended print size is 2 x 2 centimeters. It is not recommended to make it smaller, but you can always make it larger, so that your QR code is legible and can be scanned without difficulty. To ensure that all users can access your QR code, you should test with various smartphone models and apps.    </p>

                                    Aren't QR codes on websites something unnecessary?

                                It could be considered redundant or unnecessary if the QR code linked a site's home page to the same home page; which would generate an endless loop. But using QR codes on your website has the function of connecting people with other digital platforms: it is not only a bridge that connects print with digital, but it can also connect a desktop PC with mobile devices, allowing Users access mobile applications, such as social networks, podcasts or videos.
